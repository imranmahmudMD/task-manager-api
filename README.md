# task-manager-api

This application is a task manager app. 

Users can create an account for themselves, after which they can:
- Create, update and delete tasks
- tasks can be sorted by the time they were created or last updated

Users can also upload an avatar image. 

Some email notifications have also been included for account creation and deletion

I may create a front end UI for this app in due course, but have not for now
